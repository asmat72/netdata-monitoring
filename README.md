# netdata-monitoring
- 🖥️ Monitor system resources using Netdata and Docker.
- Clone the repository:  
     `git clone https://github.com/asmat72/netdata-monitoring.git`
- 📌 Objective:
     - This task demonstrates how to monitor system performance metrics using [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) deployed via Docker. Netdata provides real-time insights into CPU, memory, disk usage, and container activity through a rich web dashboard.
- 🚀 Setup Instructions"
      - 1. Run Netdata with Docker To quickly deploy Netdata using Docker.
      - 2. Access the Dashboard:
           - Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:19999
           - This will launch the Netdata dashboard where you can monitor system metrics in real time.
- 📊 Features Monitored
     - CPU Usage: Live graphs of core activity and load averages.
     - Memory Usage: RAM consumption, swap usage, and cache statistics.
     - Disk I/O: Read/write speeds and disk utilization.
     - Docker Containers: Resource usage per container.
     - Alerts & Logs: View system alerts and logs stored in /var/log/netdata.
- ✅ Outcome: 
     - Successfully deployed Netdata via Docker and visualized key system performance metrics through an interactive dashboard.
